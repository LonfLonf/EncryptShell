**"A simple GUI to assist in malware development. The main idea of this project is to help generate encrypted shellcode and the corresponding decryption code. It can generate random keys and currently supports AES encryption in C#.**

**Some features are still under development, such as selecting the encryption method and target programming language from the interface. At the moment, it only generates AES code for C#, but in the next few days I plan to add support for XOR in C#, and both AES and XOR for C."**
